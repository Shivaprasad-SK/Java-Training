# Java OOPs Training & Mini Project Repository

This repository contains structured day-wise practice on ""Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)"" in Java, along with a ""Java mini project"" developed as part of a training session. The project demonstrates a real-world client-server application using ""Swing GUI"" and ""WebSockets"".

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

/DAY1 - OOP concepts: classes, objects, and constructors
/DAY2 - Inheritance, overloading, overriding
/DAY3 - Abstraction, interfaces, access modifiers
/DAY4 - Polymorphism, encapsulation, modeling
/Package - Java programs using packages and modular structure
/Java Training Project - ⚡ Mini project: Java Swing + WebSocket Client-Server App
/dbproject - JDBC-based database programs using MySQL


---

## 🚀 Highlight: Java Training Project

### 🎯 ""Project Name:"" Remote Screenshot Client-Server System

### 🧩 ""Tech Stack:""
- Java SE 8+
- Java Swing (for GUI)
- Java WebSocket API (Client & Server communication)
- AWT Robot class (for screenshot capture)
- ServerSocket & networking
- Optional: JSON or byte array transfer for images

### 🧠 ""How it works:""

- ""Client Side:""
  - Java Swing GUI with a "Capture Screenshot" button
  - Captures screen using `java.awt.Robot`
  - Sends image data to the server via WebSocket or Socket Stream

- ""Server Side:""
  - Listens for incoming connections
  - Receives and displays (or stores) screenshot images from the client

### 📸 ""Use Case:""
Useful for remote monitoring, classroom supervision, lab sessions, or personal R&D.

## 🛠 Setup & Run Instructions

1. ""Clone the repository""
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-oops-training.git

    Open the Java Training Project folder in your IDE.

    Run the server application first:

java ServerMain.java

Then run the client application:

    java ClientMain.java

    Use the Swing interface to trigger screenshots from the client system to the server.

    Make sure client and server run on the same or accessible network/IP.
